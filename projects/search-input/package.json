  "description": "This component is a search input field built on Angular 8 and Bootstrap 4. It listens for input, pauses for a set duration (default 500 ms), checks for unique values, and then emits the text in the search field. Can be used to auto search a datasource automatically as a user is typing. Emits a changed event if the input field is cleared.",
